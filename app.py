    # Cassava
    """Cassava is a major root crop widely cultivated in Nigeria for its starchy tubers, which serve as a staple food and industrial raw material. 
    It is drought-tolerant and can be grown in poor soils, making it vital for food security.
    Climate & Soil Requirements: Prefers warm, humid tropical climates (25â€“29Â°C), sandy-loam soils (pH 5.5â€“6.5), rainfall 1,000â€“1,500 mm.
    Planting: Stem cuttings (20â€“25 cm) on ridges/mounds, spacing 1m Ã— 1m, weed regularly.
    Pests/Diseases: Cassava mealybug, green mite, cassava mosaic disease, bacterial blight.
    Harvest: 9â€“12 months after planting, process tubers within 48 hours.
    Market: Processed into garri, fufu, starch, ethanol, and feed. Nigeria is worldâ€™s largest producer.""",

    # Yam
    """Yam is a staple food crop in Nigeria, culturally significant and economically valuable. Nigeria produces over 70% of the worldâ€™s yams.
    Climate & Soil Requirements: Tropical climates (25â€“30Â°C), deep loamy soils rich in organic matter, rainfall 1,200â€“1,500 mm.
    Planting: Tuber setts or small whole tubers, spacing 1m Ã— 1m or 1.2m Ã— 1.2m, use stakes for vines.
    Pests/Diseases: Yam beetles, nematodes, anthracnose, yam mosaic virus, tuber rots.
    Harvest: 8â€“12 months after planting, store in ventilated yam barns.
    Market: Consumed boiled, pounded, fried, roasted, also exported fresh/processed.""",

    # Maize
    """Maize is an important cereal crop in Nigeria for food, livestock feed, and industry. Grown nationwide, adaptable to many climates.
    Climate & Soil Requirements: Thrives at 18â€“27Â°C, fertile well-drained soils (pH 5.5â€“7.0), rainfall 500â€“1,200 mm depending on variety.
    Planting: Direct seeding, spacing 75 cm Ã— 25 cm, apply NPK fertilizer, weed early.
    Pests/Diseases: Stem borers, armyworms, maize streak virus, rust, leaf blight.
    Harvest: Dry husks, hard kernels; dry grains to 12â€“13% moisture.
    Market: Consumed fresh or processed (pap, flour, feed), used in breweries and food industries."""
